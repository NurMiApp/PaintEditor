Creating a trigger for specific actions based on file types, such as opening `.cpp` files in an editor like Geometry Dash, is not typically supported directly because Geometry Dash is a game and not a code editor. However, if you are looking to execute a specific action or script when a `.cpp` file is modified, you can use a script or a tool designed for watching file changes in your operating system. Below is an example using a simple Python script that could potentially run a specific action when `main.cpp` or any `.cpp` file is changed.

### Python Script Using `watchdog`

First, you need to install the `watchdog` library if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install watchdog
```

Then, you can create a Python script to monitor changes in `.cpp` files:

```python
import time
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

class Watcher:
    DIRECTORY_TO_WATCH = "./"  # Set the path to the directory to watch

    def __init__(self):
        self.observer = Observer()

    def run(self):
        event_handler = Handler()
        self.observer.schedule(event_handler, self.DIRECTORY_TO_WATCH, recursive=True)
        self.observer.start()
        try:
            while True:
                time.sleep(5)
        except:
            self.observer.stop()
            print("Observer Stopped")

        self.observer.join()


class Handler(FileSystemEventHandler):

    @staticmethod
    def on_any_event(event):
        if event.is_directory:
            return None

        elif event.event_type == 'modified':
            # Take any action here when a file is modified.
            if event.src_path.endswith(".cpp"):
                print(f"Detected a change in {event.src_path}")
                # Here, you can place your code to trigger any action
                # For example, opening a file or running a command

if __name__ == '__main__':
    w = Watcher()
    w.run()
```

### Explanation of the Script

- The script uses the `watchdog` library to monitor file system events.
- It sets up an observer on the specified directory and checks for any file modifications.
- When a `.cpp` file is modified, it prints a message. At this point, you could add any specific action you want to trigger, such as logging, sending notifications, or even triggering a game-related action if you have an API or a script for that.

### Note:
- Geometry Dash, being a game, does not natively support editing or managing C++ files.
- If you need to integrate this with an actual codebase management or build system, consider using more appropriate tools or IDEs like Visual Studio Code, CLion, or even configure build systems like Make or CMake.
- This script is very basic and serves only as a starting point for monitoring file changes.

Please adjust the script paths and actions according to your specific requirements and environment.
