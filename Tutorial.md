It seems there might be a bit of confusion in the request. The `CMakeSettings.json` file is used in the 참조 of C++ development with Visual Studio to configure CMake project settings, such as build configurations and environment setup. It is not related to Geometry Dash or a "Paint trigger" as you might find in a game or graphical application.

If you are looking to configure a C++ project that involves graphical manipulation (like a paint application), you would still use `CMakeSettings.json` to configure your build settings, but the actual functionality (like a paint capability) would be implemented in your C++ code, not within the `CMakeSettings.json` file itself.

To clarify, here’s how you might use `CMakeSettings.json` in a typical C++ project setup in Visual Studio with CMake:

### Example `CMakeSettings.json` for a C++ Project

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "x64-Debug",
      "generator": "Ninja",
      "configurationType": "Debug",
      "inheritEnvironments": [ "msvc_x64_x64" ],
      "buildRoot": "${projectDir}\\out\\build\\${name}",
      "installRoot": "${projectDir}\\out\\install\\${name}",
      "cmakeCommandArgs": "",
      "buildCommandArgs": "-v",
      "ctestCommandArgs": "",
      "variables": [
        {
          "name": "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE",
          "value": "path/to/your/toolchain/file"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementing a Paint Functionality in C++

If your project involves creating a painting tool or similar graphical functionalities, you’d implement that in your C++ source files using graphics libraries such as Qt, SDL, or SFML. Here’s a very basic outline of what the code might look like using SFML:

```cpp
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

int main() {
    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(800, 600), "Simple Paint Program");
    sf::CircleShape brush(5.f); // Simple brush represented as a circle
    brush.setFillColor(sf::Color::Red);

    while (window.isOpen()) {
        sf::Event event;
        while (window.pollEvent(event)) {
            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
                window.close();

            if (event.type == sf::Event::MouseButtonPressed) {
                if (event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Left) {
                    brush.setPosition(static_cast<float>(event.mouseButton.x), static_cast<float>(event.mouseButton.y));
                    window.draw(brush);
                }
            }
        }

        window.display();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion
- **CMakeSettings.json**: Use this file for configuring build settings in a CMake-based C++ project within Visual Studio.
- **C++ Code**: Implement the logic for any application functionalities, such as painting, within your C++ source files using appropriate libraries.
