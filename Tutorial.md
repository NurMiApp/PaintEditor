Creating a `.gitignore` file that covers a wide range of build artifacts, intermediate files, and editor-specific files is a common practice to keep a repository clean and ensure that only relevant source files and necessary resources are tracked. Below is a `.gitignore` template that includes the categories you've mentioned, tailored for a typical C++ project using various tools and environments including Visual Studio, Sublime Text, and macOS.

### Explanation:
- **Object files and libraries**: Extensions such as `.o`, `.obj`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`, `.a`, and `.lib` refer to compiled outputs and libraries which shouldn't be tracked.
- **Precompiled headers**: These files (`.gch`, `.pch`) are specific to a system or compiler version and should not be shared through source control.
- **Executable files**: Extensions like `.exe`, `.out`, and `.app` are platform-specific binaries.
- **Editor and IDE specific folders**: Such as `.vscode/`, `.DS_Store` (macOS), and Visual Studio files.
- **Build directories**: Common build output directories like `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, etc. are excluded to prevent tracking of build artifacts.
- **Temporary and cache files**: Including those for Sublime Text, and general temporary files like `.swp`, `*~`, `.bak`, `.tmp`, `.temp`.

This `.gitignore` file should be placed in the root directory of your repository. Git will then automatically ignore the files and paths specified when adding and committing files to your repository. Adjust and extend this template according to the specific needs and tools of your project.
